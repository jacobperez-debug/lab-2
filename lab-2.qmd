# Instructions

**Create a Quarto file for ALL Lab 2 (no separate files for Parts 1 and 2).**

- Make sure your final file is carefully formatted, so that each analysis is
clear and concise.
- Be sure your knitted `.html` file shows **all** your source code, including
any function definitions. 

# Part One: Identifying Bad Visualizations

If you happen to be bored and looking for a sensible chuckle, you should check
out these [Bad Visualisations](https://badvisualisations.tumblr.com/). Looking through these is also a good exercise in cataloging what makes a visualization
good or bad. 

## Dissecting a Bad Visualization

Below is an example of a less-than-ideal visualization from the collection
linked above. It comes to us from data provided for the [Wellcome Global Monitor 2018 report](https://wellcome.ac.uk/reports/wellcome-global-monitor/2018) by the 
Gallup World Poll:

![](images/bad-wellcome-graph.jpg)

1. While there are certainly issues with this image, do your best to tell the
story of this graph in words. That is, what is this graph telling you? What do
you think the authors meant to convey with it?

This graph seems to plot the distribution of the percentage of people who believe vaccines are safe for each country. The distributions are separated by continents with a horizontal median bar displayed for each continent. I believe the message of this graph is supposed to show which continents believe in vaccines the most as the graph is organized from highest median percentage per continent to lowest median percentage. The graph also labels the extreme values in each continent, which are the countries, so you can see by continent which countries have the lowest and the highest percentage. 

2. List the variables that appear to be displayed in this visualization. 
*Hint: Variables refer to columns in the data.*

The columns seem to be continent, country, and percent who believe vaccines are safe.

3. Now that you're versed in the grammar of graphics (e.g., `ggplot`), list the *aesthetics* used and which *variables* are mapped to each.



4. What type of graph would you call this? Meaning, what `geom` would you use
to produce this plot?

This would be a geom_point() graph or a dot plot. It seems to be dot plots of each continent stacked on top of each other.

5. Provide at least four problems or changes that would improve this graph. 
*Please format your changes as bullet points!*

The first change I would make would be to remove the legend as there is no need since it is labeled on the graphs. 

## Improving the Bad Visualization

The data for the Wellcome Global Monitor 2018 report can be downloaded at the following site: [https://wellcome.ac.uk/reports/wellcome-global-monitor/2018](https://wellcome.org/sites/default/files/wgm2018-dataset-crosstabs-all-countries.xlsx)

<!-- at the "Dataset and crosstabs for all countries" link on the right side of the page-->

There are two worksheets in the downloaded dataset file. You may need to read
them in separately, but you may also just use one if it suffices.

```{r}
#| label: read-in-wellcome-data
library(readxl)

wgm2018 <- read_excel(here::here("wgm2018-dataset-crosstabs-all-countries.xlsx"), sheet = 2)

wgm20183 <- read_excel(here::here("wgm2018-dataset-crosstabs-all-countries.xlsx"), sheet = 3)
```

6. Improve the visualization above by either re-creating it with the issues you
identified fixed OR by creating a new visualization that you believe tells the
same story better.

```{r}
#| label: new-and-improved-visualization

library(tidyverse)

df_raw <- tibble(x = str_split(wgm20183$`Variable Type & Codes*`[1], ',\\s')[[1]])

df_countries <- df_raw |>
  separate_wider_delim(x, delim = '=', names = c("country_id", "country_name")) |>
  mutate(country_id = as.numeric(country_id))
```

```{r}
#| label: join two datasets

wgm2018_joined <-  left_join(wgm2018, df_countries, by = c("WP5" = "country_id")) |>
  mutate(region = case_when(
    Regions_Report %in% c(1, 2, 4, 5) ~ "Africa",
    Regions_Report %in% c(6, 7, 8) ~ "Americas",
    Regions_Report %in% c(9, 10, 11, 12, 18) ~ "Asia",
    Regions_Report %in% c(3, 13) ~ "Middle East and North Africa",
    Regions_Report %in% c(14) ~ "Former Soviet Union",
    Regions_Report %in% c(15, 16, 17, 0) ~ "Europe"
  )) |>
  select(country_name, region, wgt, PROJWT, Q25)
```

```{r}
#| label: summarize proporitons

summary_df <- wgm2018_joined |>
  filter(!is.na(Q25)) |>
  group_by(country_name, region) |>
  summarise(
    total_responses = n(),
    count = sum(Q25 %in% c(1, 2)),
    prop = count / total_responses
  ) |>
  select(country_name, region, prop)
```

```{r}
ggplot(summary_df, aes(x = prop, y = country_name)) +
  geom_point(color = "black", size = 2.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ region, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(
    x = "% of people who responded 1 or 2",
    y = NULL,
    title = "Belief in Vaccine Safety by Country and Region",
    subtitle = "Proportion of responses that were 1 or 2 on Q25 (e.g., 'Strongly agree')"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  theme(
    strip.text = element_text(face = "bold"),
    panel.spacing = unit(1, "lines")
  )
```

# Part Two: Broad Visualization Improvement

The full Wellcome Global Monitor 2018 report can be found here: [https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wellcome-global-monitor-2018.pdf](https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wellcome-global-monitor-2018.pdf). 
Surprisingly, the visualization above does not appear in the report despite the
citation in the bottom corner of the image!

## Second Data Visualization Improvement

**For this second plot, you must select a plot that uses maps so you can demonstrate your proficiency with the `leaflet` package!**

7. Select a data visualization in the report that you think could be improved. 
Be sure to cite both the page number and figure title. Do your best to tell the
story of this graph in words. That is, what is this graph telling you? What do
you think the authors meant to convey with it?



8. List the variables that appear to be displayed in this visualization.



9. Now that you're versed in the grammar of graphics (ggplot), list the
aesthetics used and which variables are specified for each.



10. What type of graph would you call this?



11. List all of the problems or things you would improve about this graph.  

12. Improve the visualization above by either re-creating it with the issues you identified fixed OR by creating a new visualization that you believe tells the same story better.

```{r}
#| label: second-improved-visualization


```

## Third Data Visualization Improvement

**For this third plot, you must use one of the other `ggplot2` extension packages mentioned this week (e.g., `gganimate`, `plotly`, `patchwork`, `cowplot`).**
 
13. Select a data visualization in the report that you think could be improved. 
Be sure to cite both the page number and figure title. Do your best to tell the
story of this graph in words. That is, what is this graph telling you? What do
you think the authors meant to convey with it?



14. List the variables that appear to be displayed in this visualization.



15. Now that you're versed in the grammar of graphics (ggplot), list the
aesthetics used and which variables are specified for each.



16. What type of graph would you call this?



17. List all of the problems or things you would improve about this graph.  

18. Improve the visualization above by either re-creating it with the issues you identified fixed OR by creating a new visualization that you believe tells the same story better.
